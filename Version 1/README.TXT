PROJECT TITLE: Graduation Progress

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Shows how far along a college student is prior to
graduating from Olivet College. This was a project that my classmate
and I worked on during class last semester (Fall 2019), which aimed to
give us experience in working on larger software engineering projects
for a client or company.

VERSION or DATE: Presented November 25th, 2019

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Read user instructions. Note that this is
only written as a simulation at the moment.

AUTHORS: Jaden Costa, Noah Bailey

USER INSTRUCTIONS: This version is submitted purely as a simulation,
using pre-written student information and class credentials. The user
upon first downloading the zip file would first run the setup Python
file, which will update the students.py file. The Python files labeled
classes.py and login.py will be essential for running the next part of
the project. 

The classes.py file holds the class declarations for each
student, and the login.py file holds the frame for the login screen
which will be used later. 

The user would then run the main.py file which will prompt the user to
log in using the credentials for one of the users saved in the
students.py file. Once the user has successfully logged in, the file
will open a window displaying the credits the student has yet to take
in order to graduate from their institution (in this case, the
institution is Olivet College) with a degree in their chosen major. 
Please note that these graduation requirements can be found on the
Olivet College portal to anyone holding a valid Olivet College email.
